Sol's design was chosen to be the base of the remainder of the project due to neatness & organization

Added lookupTileCoordinates to be able to locate a specific tile on the board, returning its current coordinates.

Added a followRoute function which finds the end of a route.
addTile's makePermanent links a tile to the board without permanently placing it on the board.
validPlacement is a function that takes the tile and location and checks if the movement is valid.

trackOwner was added to playerData to keep track of who owns which tracks, not currently used; implemented for later strategy.
updateOurStations is a list that stores our stations that are not complete and what their scores are; is updated during move info right before our turn.
